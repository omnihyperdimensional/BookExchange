5). Now that you have a copy of the **Master** in your personal branch, select **Open in Visual Studio Code** (this will open all </br> 
files in the your branch in VSC) or you can just go to **htdocs** and work on those files.</br>

## Committing and Pushing to your Branch

If any changes are made to the files in the repository, they will show in the GitHub Desktop app, make sure that when
you are done, in the botton left corner you provide a brief description of your changes, and click **Commit to (the name of your branch)**</br>

Then, you have to push your commits to the origin by clicking in **Push Origin** in the GitHub Desktop app. </br>
**(make sure you are committing and pushing to you personal branch)**</br>

## Merging to the Master Branch

After you are done, and you are rady to merge in the master branch you can just do it from the GitHub webpage by going to **your branch** in the repository and clicking on **Compare and Pull Rquest**, give a description of what is that you are merging and
then you will require **2 people to revise your code**; then if accepted your code will merge to the master, if not you will have to check your code.</br>
