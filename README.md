# Book Exchange

A CS3337 @ Cal State LA project.</br>
Book Exchange is a web application that alows students to trade and/or buy books from each other.</br>

## Setup 

1). Create your personal branch with your name on it.</br>
2). Download the GitHub Desktop.</br>
3). Open GitHub Desktop, sign in -> click **File** -> **Clone a Repository** -> Select **BookExchange** -> Save in </br> **C:\Apache24\htdocs\BookExchange** (or wherever your **htdocs** folder is at).</br>
4). On **Current Branch** make sure to select yours.</br>
5). Now that you have a copy of the **Master** in your personal branch you can just go to **htdocs** -> **BookExchange** and work on those files.</br>

## Committing and Pushing to your Branch

If any changes are made to the files in your branch, they will show in the GitHub Desktop app, make sure that when
you are done editing, in the botton left corner of the GitHub Desktop app provide a brief description of your changes, and click **Commit to (the name of your branch)**</br>

Then, you have to push your commits to the origin by clicking in **Push Origin** in the GitHub Desktop app.
**(make sure you are committing and pushing to you personal branch)**

## Merging and Pulling to/from the Master Branch 

After you are done, and you are ready to merge in the master branch you can just do it from the GitHub webpage by going to **your branch** and clicking on **Compare and Pull Request**, give a description of what is that you are merging and 
then create a pull request, you will require **1 people to revise your code**; then if accepted your code will merge to the master, if not you will be notified.

If need to pull a copy of the most recent **Master Branch** in the GitHub Desktop click on **Branch** -> **Update From Master**.
This will **OVERRIDE** your branch, so **make sure to merge any changes you have made to the master before trying to pull from the master branch.**

You are more than welcome to create more branches if needed (They just serve as clones of the master branch).</br>
If you need to make some small changes, you can just edit directly from the master branch. And select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request** this will create a new branch as _your_branch_name-patch-#_ just for commiting the changes made to that specific file.
