A CS3337 @ Cal State LA project.</br>
Book Exchange is a web application that alows students to trade and/or buy books from each other.</br>

## Setup 

1). Create your personal branch with your name on it.</br>
2). Download the GitHub Desktop.</br>
3). Open GitHub Desktop, sign in -> click **File** -> **Clone a Repository** -> Select **BookExchange** -> Save in </br> **C:\Apache24\htdocs\BookExchange** (or wherever your **htdocs** folder is at).</br>
4). On **Current Branch** make sure to select yours.</br>
5). Now that you have a copy of the **Master** in your personal branch you can just go to **htdocs** and work on those files.</br>

## Committing and Pushing to your Branch

If any changes are made to the files in the repository, they will show in the GitHub Desktop app, make sure that when
you are done, in the botton left corner of the GitHub Desktop app provide a brief description of your changes, and click **Commit to (the name of your branch)**</br>

Then, you have to push your commits to the origin by clicking in **Push Origin** in the GitHub Desktop app. </br>
**(make sure you are committing and pushing to you personal branch)**</br>

## Merging and Pulling to/from the Master Branch 

After you are done, and you are ready to merge in the master branch you can just do it from the GitHub webpage by going to **your</br> branch** in the repository and clicking on **Compare and Pull Rquest**, give a description of what is that you are merging and </br>
then you will require **2 people to revise your code**; then if accepted your code will merge to the master, if not you will have</br> to check your code.</br>

If need to pull a copy of the most recent **Master Branch** in the GitHub Desktop click on **Branch** -> **Update From Master**</br>
make sure you save any changes in your personal branch since this will **OVERRIDE** your code.
